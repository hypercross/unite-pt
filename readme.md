unite-pt
================

A [unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim/) source to list files with [pt](https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher).
Needs [Vimproc](https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim) to be asynchronous, you may very well be using the [Kaoriya](https://www.kaoriya.net/software/vim/) build of gvim if you have it.

This thing can only justify its existence if you are on Windows and unite's file_rec/async somehow doesn't work(like on my machine).

Code was mostly taken from [unite-everything](https://github.com/sgur/unite-everything) as it looked like easier documentation on this than Shougo's English.

Man, Shougo is the sore reason why gvim on windows is still usable.
